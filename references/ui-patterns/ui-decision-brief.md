# UI decision brief

Produce this after the UX decision brief and before implementation. Keep it compact enough to guide code generation.

UI decision brief
- Surface type: marketing / dashboard / native settings / editor / mobile flow / checkout / agent run
- Platform idiom: web / Windows / Apple / Android / cross-platform translation
- Product thesis: the specific job, risk, queue, artifact, or decision this surface exists for
- Desktop archetype: command center / library / workbench / monitoring cockpit / tray utility / media consumer / document app / setup preferences, if desktop
- Originality seed: subject, metaphor, world, main object, layout premise, repeated motif, weird move, restraints
- Composition archetype: cockpit / map-table / specimen tray / command deck / ledger / timeline wall / studio desk / terminal board / light table / magazine spread / object-detail stage / inspection bay / archive index / instrument panel
- Layout sketch: compact named regions before code, based on the product job rather than generic cards
- Typography personality: display, UI/body, mono labels, why it fits, and banned fallback
- Visual direction: ...
- Creative direction: see `creative-direction.md` brief, including world, mood, visual metaphor, material language, typography personality, layout grammar, motion voice, repeated motif, forbidden defaults, tasteful risk, and restraints
- Density: sparse / balanced / dense / operational
- Hierarchy: primary visual, primary action, secondary surfaces
- Component grammar: cards, tables, panes, toolbars, sheets, tabs, forms, command surface
- Typography: system/native or chosen custom pair, scale, emphasis rule
- Color/materials: background, surfaces, accent, semantic states
- Motion budget: none / subtle / signature / expressive, plus reduced-motion behavior
- Implementation track: static / Vite + React / Next / Astro / other, plus dependency risk notes
- Responsive containment: nav, table/list, toolbar, inspector, and long-label behavior
- Cinematic system: campaign / editorial scroll story / product proof / immersive brand, if applicable
- Key art: subject, material, framing, depth, and reuse plan
- Art direction: visual metaphor, typography system, palette, motion language, repeated motif
- Page rhythm: hero, context, proof/craft, collection, trust/place, final close
- Asset plan: icons, screenshots, generated UI mock, imagegen, typography, references, attribution
- Reference extraction: shipped references used, structural lessons, rejected visual/copy elements
- Assets: real product media, generated illustration, icons, screenshots, data visualizations, none
- State visuals: empty, loading, error, permission, success, long-running
- Tasteful risk: one deliberate unusual choice and the restraints that keep it coherent
- Bans: ...
```

This brief prevents the common failure where the agent picks decent components but no coherent visual system.

## Rules

- Dense work tools need stable layout more than animation.
- Dense regions need intentional containment: table scroll, priority-column list, sheet/drawer, or breakpoint-specific replacement.
- Dashboards need a product-specific operational thesis before visual polish; avoid generic CRM/admin furniture with interchangeable labels.
- Assets must prove the product job or strengthen the visual direction; reject decorative filler.
- Marketing pages need a memorable first viewport and one clear conversion path.
- Creative pages need one concrete world and one tasteful risk, not many unrelated effects.
- Cinematic landing pages need one key-art system and page rhythm before motion decisions.
- Web stacks must match the product surface: React is useful for stateful, componentized, animated work, but static pages should stay simpler when possible.
- Native apps need platform materials, type, icons, spacing, and controls before custom flair.
- Editor tools need canvas dominance and control stability.
- If UX and UI conflict, preserve the user's job and recovery path first.
