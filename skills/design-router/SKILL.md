# design-router — platform dispatch

This skill is the entry point when a UI/UX request is ambiguous. Goal: pick the right UX and platform skill, do not over-eagerly route to web.

## What This Router Can Dispatch

- UX flow work: user journeys, IA, onboarding, checkout, forms, dashboards, state design, recovery, and repeated-use ergonomics.
- Platform UI work: web, Windows, Apple, Android, and cross-platform translation.
- Visual quality work: originality, desktop archetypes, creative direction, anti-default rewrites, motion/interaction choices, assets, references, and design tokens.

## Step 0 - Decide whether UX comes first

Route to `ux-design` before platform visuals when the request includes:

- "UX", "user journey", "flow", "wireframe", "information architecture", "IA", "usability"
- onboarding, signup, checkout, paywall, forms, settings, permissions, dashboard workflow, admin workflow
- CRM, admin panel, internal tool, SaaS dashboard, marketplace, editor/canvas tool, setup wizard, command palette, data table
- empty/loading/error states, long-running task progress, retry/resume, bulk actions, saved filters, audit trails
- making an app easier to use, less confusing, better for daily use, or better for conversion/retention

If the request is both UX and platform-specific, read `ux-design` first, then the matching platform skill.

## Step 1 — Read the request for platform signals

Scan for explicit signals (in priority order):

| Signal in request | Route to |
|---|---|
| "onboarding", "checkout", "signup", "form flow", "empty state", "loading state", "error state", "admin workflow", "CRM", "internal tool", "SaaS dashboard", "user journey" | `ux-design` first, then platform skill |
| "translate this UI", "translate this screen", "translate this design", "port this UI", "convert this screen", "from iOS to Windows", "from Apple to Android" | `cross-platform-design` first, then the target platform skill |
| "design tokens", "export tokens", "DTCG", "token JSON", "ColorScheme", "Typography tokens", "Tailwind tokens", "SwiftUI tokens", "Compose tokens" | `design-tokens` |
| `.tsx` `.jsx` `.html` `.svelte` `.vue`, "Tailwind", "Next.js", "Astro", "shadcn", "landing page", "marketing site", "dashboard in React" | `web-design` |
| `.xaml` `.cs` (with `WinUI`/`UWP`/`WPF`), "Windows app", "Fluent", "Mica", "WinUI", "Win11", "Microsoft Store app", "PowerToys-style" | `windows-design` |
| `.swift` `.swiftui`, "SwiftUI", "iOS app", "iPadOS", "macOS", "Liquid Glass", "HIG", "SF Symbols", "App Store", "Tahoe" | `apple-design` |
| `.kt` `.kts`, "Compose", "Jetpack Compose", "Material 3", "Material You", "Pixel app", "Android app" | `android-design` |
| "Tauri", "Electron", "Flutter", "React Native", "Expo", "Compose Multiplatform", "CMP", "Uno Platform", "Avalonia", "MAUI" | `cross-platform-design` |

## Step 2 — When signals are absent

Ask one question, no more:

> "Which platform is this for? **(1) Web** - React/Tailwind/Astro **(2) Windows** - WinUI 3 / WPF **(3) iOS / macOS** - SwiftUI **(4) Android** - Jetpack Compose **(5) Cross-platform** - Tauri 2, Compose Multiplatform, React Native, Flutter. If this is mainly UX, describe the user flow and I'll start there."

Do not assume web. Web defaults are how the official `frontend-design` skill produces native-looking-wrong code.

## Step 3 — Multi-target requests

If the user wants the same product on multiple platforms (e.g. "iOS + Android + web"):
1. Ask which platform is **canonical** (where the design originates). Usually iOS or web.
2. Build the canonical version first.
3. Then translate per-platform via `cross-platform-design` or successive single-platform skills, **respecting each idiom**, not pixel-cloning.

Same product ≠ same UI. A Settings screen on iOS uses grouped Form, on Android uses LargeTopAppBar + LazyColumn, on Windows uses NavigationView + SettingsCard. Translate idiom, not pixels.

## Step 4 — Hand off

Once routed, the UX or platform SKILL.md takes over. State what you picked and why in one sentence, then proceed.

If UX ran first, carry its `UX decision brief` into the platform skill and preserve the job, state coverage, action hierarchy, and recovery path.

For any build/redesign request, also carry a `UI decision brief` from `../../references/ui-patterns/ui-decision-brief.md` into the platform skill. This keeps visual hierarchy, density, component grammar, and motion budget explicit.

## Anti-patterns this skill exists to prevent

- Generating React/Tailwind when user wants a Windows app
- Pasting Inter on iOS where SF Pro belongs
- Reaching for Tauri/Electron when the user said "Windows app" (those are web-in-window — use WinUI 3 unless web stack is mandated)
- Defaulting to Material Design on Apple platforms
- Making a beautiful screen while ignoring empty/error/loading states and repeated-use flow

When uncertain, ask. One clarifying question is cheaper than 800 lines of wrong-platform code.
